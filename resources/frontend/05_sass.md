# Sass
A CSS-preprocessor.
What this means is that when you code in Sass, it will eventually compile into real CSS. Working with CSS is kind of annoying and archaic, so CSS-preprocessors are great for taking shortcuts to get what you want.

In other words, it's just an easier way to do CSS.

 - Supports CSS short-handing i.e. removes a lot of redundant CSS code, semicolon problems, braces problems, etc.
 - Supports variables!
 - Easy importing of other sass files
