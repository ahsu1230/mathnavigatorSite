# MathNavigator Clients

This directory should contain all CLI scripts that relate to any of the constellation services. Any script that benefits a developer's workflow or performs tasks outside of a web-server/web-client should be placed here with documentation of usage. Please place each script in its own directory.

**For every client script, please include examples of how to use it**.
